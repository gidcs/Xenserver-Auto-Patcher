# Xenserver-Auto-Patcher
Xenserver Auto Patcher

This project is abandoned.
XenServer is not friendly anymore for free users.
Hotfix does not allowed to install in the free version recently.
IO monitoring, rate limit, CPU usage, and all of the features you might need does not work.
Citrix just give up on bugfix and introduce more new version come with less feature as well as more and more bug.
I was suffered for quite a long time and finally move to KVM.
XenServer is just a BUGGY and DYING operating system.
Please don't try XenServer if you are a newcomer.
Try to migrate to KVM if you are still using XenServer. God bless you.
