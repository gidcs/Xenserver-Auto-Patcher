# Xenserver-Auto-Patcher
Xenserver Auto Patcher

```
This project was abandoned.
For free users, XenServer is no longer friendly.
Hotfixes are not allowed to be installed in the free version recently.
IO monitoring, rate limiting, CPU usage, and all the features you might need don't work.
Citrix just gave up bugfix, then introduced more new versions with fewer features and more and more bugs.
I suffered a long time and finally moved to KVM.
XenServer is just a BUGGY and DYING operating system.
If you are a newbie, please don't try XenServer.
If you are still using XenServer, try migrating to KVM. God bless you.
